# weather_and_mood

# Project Idea

In this project, I will be collecting and analyzing the weather in my area, the time i spent outside and in the nature and how these factors effect my general mood for that day. I aim to spend enough time outside and inside to get precise results to decide whether it
these factors have good or bad effects on my mood. There will also be an extreme deduction factor to eliminate the biased data when there are different extreme factors that effect my mood.

# Description Of Dataset

- **Date:** Information to track the continuity.
- **Weather:** Weather information that will be tracked throughout the day from OpenWeather API.
- **Out:** Information of whether i went out or did not.
- **Time Spent Out:** The data of time that i have spent outside in minutes.
- **Time Spent in Nature:** The data of time that i have spent in nature in minutes.
- **Mood:** My overall mood at that day.
- **Inconsistency:** The information of whether there was an unnatural event that affected my mood besides the weather factor. This is collected to reduce the biased data.
