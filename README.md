# weather_and_mood

# Project Idea

In this project, I will be collecting and analyzing the weather in my area, the time i spent outside and in the nature and how these factors effect my general mood for that day. I aim to spend enough time outside and inside to get precise results to decide whether it
these factors have good or bad effects on my mood. There will also be an extreme deduction factor to eliminate the biased data when there are different extreme factors that effect my mood.

# Description Of Dataset

- **Date:** Information to track the specific day to ensure accurate chronological analysis.
- **Weather Condition:** Weather data such as temperature, precipitation, cloud coverage, gathered using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Out:** Information of whether i went out or did not.
- **Time Spent Out:** The data of time that i have spent outside in minutes.
- **Time Spent in Nature:** The data of time that i have spent in nature in minutes.
- **Mood:** My overall mood at that day.
- **Inconsistency:** Indicates whether there was an unnatural event that affected my mood besides the weather conditions. This is collected to reduce the biased data.

# Plan
## Data Collection
- **Duration:** Data will be collected between 10th of March and 10th of April under these conditions:
- **Tools:**
  - **Weather Data:** Will be collected using OpenWeatherMap API.
  - **Mood Tracking:** I will manually input by myself.
  - **Time Tracking:** Duration will be calculated automatically with a clock.
  - **Data Management:** Data will be systematically organized and stored, facilitating easy access and analysis.
- **Data Recording:** Data will be consistently logged immediately after events to minimize biases and ensure accuracy.
- **Data Management:** Data will be systematically organized and stored, facilitating easy access and analysis.
## Data Preparation and Analysis
- Verify completeness and consistency of the collected data.
- Deduce the inconsistent days to have an unbiased data.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends and reach to a conclusion.
